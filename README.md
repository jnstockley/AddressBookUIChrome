Verison 2.0 has been released!

This is the biggest update since I have release the first address book!

## Key Features
 - Updated to match current version of Address Book UI
 
 ## How to Set Up your own server!
  If you want to create your own server please read the README on the AddressBookUI repository
  
 ## How to use my server!
  If you would like to run this extension currently the only way is to download it from the releases tab and load it manually. I am trying to get this extension approved on the chrome and firefox webstore. Opera might come at a later date!

 ## Commonly Asked Questions?
  - How do I run the broweser extension?
    - Firefox: You can download the extension from the firefox add on store here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/addressbookui/
    - Opera: I have submitted my extension for review on the opera add-ons store. It is currently under review right now. If you are running the beat or developer version of opera it should be available on the add-ons store. Otherwise for now you will have to side-load the extension by downloading the zip file from the releases tab.
    - Chrome/Chromium: Right now I keep getting rejected when I try to publish the extension. I will try again later but for know you will have to side-load the extension. You can download the zip file from the releases tab
    - Safari: No support now and no plan on supporting in the future.
    - Other browsers: If you submit a broweser request under the issues tab I will try to get a version working for your browser. Be sure to use the request tag!
    
 - What operating systems are supported?
   - Any version of chrome, chromium, opera, or firefox based browser that allows you to install extenstions
   
- When will the REST and CLI versions of this be updated?
  - All version are upadated and running! You can check them out on my profile home page!
  
- Will you continue to update this software with new features and bug fixes?
  - Yes of course, I do still have some features I plan on adding at some point. Right now I am planning on updating the backend on both the REST interface and CLI and converting the CLI into a maven project
